    <data name="Tri core.Description" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>The Tri Core family of sleep schedules are relatively unusual and not very popular. This is due to hard scheduling of sleep along with wake time activities. The schedules in this group have an SWS-focused core, a REM-focused core, and a mixed core. All these cores only have a single cycle. The number of naps is also very low compared to other schedules (between 0 and 2).</value>

    <data name="Dual core.Description" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>Polyphasic Society originally proposed the Dual Core (DC) family of sleep schedules based on Segmented sleep.It is typically more difficult to adapt to these schedules than to Everyman schedules. Like with Everyman schedules, the naming of Dual Core schedules is based on how many naps it contains.</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Biphasic.Description" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>Schedules in the Biphasic family of sleep schedules typically consist of only two sleep blocks. The main biphasic sleep schedules are Segmented, Siesta and Biphasic-X. Interestingly, they have been the main sleep schedules for a long time throughout human history in some way. Needless to say, they continue to work very well in the modern world.</value>

    <data name="Everyman.Description" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>Everyman sleep is a less extreme alternative to Uberman. Puredoxyk, who named and popularized Uberman, eventually proposed Everyman. It then became E3 to adapt to less sleep more easily while promoting nap flexibility. She reported this as sustainable once her child was a few years old; someone else would watch the child during her naps. </value>
